In 2005, an internet meme was started when a woman, trying to sell a TV, put a banana in her sale ad as a unit of measurement. Since then, [__'Banana For Scale'__](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/banana-for-scale) has grown in popularity and has been dubbed the [__'yardstick of the internet'__](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/banana-for-scale-meme-history/)

So this got me thinking, what if you could use a banana as an actual unit for scale in an image?

Unfortunetly, you'll have to wait for Capstone 3 to find out.
